# Carafe.js

This JavaScript turbo-charges any Carafe Bundle project. It provides a Bundle developer with useful features such as a head loader, FM WebViewer Bridge, and a `ready` function that ensures all dependencies are loaded before your Bundle runs.

## Installation

To use Carafe.js in your Bundle, you can include it from a CDN, or you can include the [19kb of minified code](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/soliantconsulting/carafe@0.7.3/dist/Carafe.js) inside a `<script  type="application/javascript"></script>` tag.

```html
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/soliantconsulting/carafe@0.7.3/dist/Carafe.js"></script>
```
